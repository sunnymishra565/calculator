## Calculator Application
Description
A calculator application is a software tool designed to perform mathematical operations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex calculations. It is an essential utility for students, professionals, and anyone needing quick and accurate computations.

## Key Features
1. Basic Operations
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Advanced Mathematical Functions
Square root, exponents, logarithms, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
Support for percentages and factorials.
3. Scientific Mode
Advanced calculations, including engineering functions, radians/degrees mode, and constants like Ï€ and e.
4. Programmer Mode
Binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal conversions.
Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR).
5. Graphing Mode (Optional)
Plot functions on a 2D or 3D graph.
Interactive zoom and pan capabilities for detailed views.
6. Memory Functions
Save and recall numbers for repeated use.
Memory clear and cumulative addition/subtraction.
7. Customization
Change themes (light/dark mode).
Configurable settings for precision and display format (e.g., scientific notation).
8. History and Replay
View a log of previous calculations.
Replay or edit previous entries.
9. Multi-Platform Compatibility
Accessible on mobile, desktop, and web platforms.
